# Pokémon VGC Basics

## What is VGC?

The Pokémon Video Game Championship (VGC) is the official competitive format for Pokémon games run by The Pokémon Company International. It features double battles (2v2) with teams of 4-6 Pokémon, requiring strategic team building, prediction, and adaptation.

## Competitive Circuit Structure

The competitive circuit follows a season structure:

- **Local Events**: Premier Challenges and Midseason Showdowns at authorized venues
- **Regional Championships**: Larger tournaments held in major cities
- **International Championships**: Major events in North America, Europe, Oceania, and Latin America
- **World Championships**: Season-culminating event with qualified players from around the world

Players earn Championship Points through tournament placements to qualify for Worlds. Online competitions also offer practice and sometimes Championship Points.

## Format Rotations

"Rotations" in VGC refer to rule changes that occur periodically:

- **Game Version**: Rules update when new Pokémon games release
- **Series Rules**: Changes within a season that modify allowed Pokémon
- **Restricted Legendaries**: Some formats allow limited legendary Pokémon
- **Item Clauses**: Restrictions on duplicate items
- **Team Preview**: Shows opponent's team before selecting battle Pokémon

The format typically refreshes annually with new ruleset announcements. These rotations prevent metagame stagnation and challenge players to adapt team building strategies regularly.
